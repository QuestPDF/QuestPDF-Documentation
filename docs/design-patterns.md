# Design patterns

## Concepts

[Document metadata](/concepts/document-metadata) - learn how to apply metadata (e.g. title, author, subject) to the PDF document.

[Generating output](/concepts/generating-output) - describes how to generate PDF and XPS documents, as well as image snapshots of each page.

[Execution order](/concepts/execution-order) - discusses how method invocation order in the Fluent API changes the result.

[Creating DSL](/concepts/creating-dsl) - shows how to compose standard Fluent API methods into C# extension methods to achieve project-specific functionality and simplify code.

[Components](/concepts/components) - explains how you can prepare implement reusable layout structures shared across many document types.

[Dynamic components](/concepts/dynamic-components) - describes how to implement most advanced layouts by generating conditional, page-specific content.

[Length unit types](/concepts/length-unit-types) - list of standard length unit types that can be used instead of points.

[Colors](/concepts/colors) - list of predefined colors based on the material design.

[Basic fonts](/concepts/basic-fonts) - a collection of standard PDF fonts.

[Prototyping](/concepts/prototyping) - learn how to use various additional tools to speed up prototyping process.

[Exceptions](/concepts/exceptions) - explains all exception types thrown by QuestPDF and how to tackle them.


## Examples

[Complex layouts](/examples/complex-layouts) - how to combine the Row and Columns elements to accomplish complex and scalable visual layouts.

[Custom first page](/examples/custom-first-page) - using the ShowOnce and SkipOnce elements to achieve custom first page in the document.

[Implementing charts](/examples/implementing-charts) - implementing charts and injecting them to the document.

## Going production

[Platform specific dependencies](/going-production/platform-specific-dependencies) - describes additional required NuGet packages on various platforms, e.g. Linux or MacOS. 

[Font management](/going-production/font-management) - shows how to include custom fonts in your project, so to not rely on the runtime environment.

[Reducing output size](/going-production/reducing-output-size) - discusses various techniques used to reduce size of the PDF output file.
