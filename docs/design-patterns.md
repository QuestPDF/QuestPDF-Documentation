# Design patterns

## Concepts

[Document metadata](/concepts/document-metadata) - learn how to apply metadata (e.g. title, author, subject) to the PDF document.

[Generating output](/concepts/generating-output) - describes how to generate PDF and XPS documents, as well as image snapshots of each page.

[Merging documents](/concepts/merging-documents) - learn how to generate a single PDF file containing multiple documents.

[Execution order](/concepts/execution-order) - discusses how method invocation order in the Fluent API changes the result.

[Creating DSL](/concepts/creating-dsl) - shows how to compose standard Fluent API methods into C# extension methods to achieve project-specific functionality and simplify code.

[Components](/concepts/components) - explains how you can prepare implement reusable layout structures shared across many document types.

[Dynamic components](/concepts/dynamic-components) - describes how to implement most advanced layouts by generating conditional, page-specific content.

[Length unit types](/concepts/length-unit-types) - list of standard length unit types that can be used instead of points.

[Colors](/concepts/colors) - list of predefined colors based on the material design.

[Prototyping](/concepts/prototyping) - learn how to use various additional tools to speed up prototyping process.

[Exceptions](/concepts/exceptions) - explains all exception types thrown by QuestPDF and how to tackle them.


## Examples

[Custom first page](/examples/custom-first-page) - using the ShowOnce and SkipOnce elements to achieve custom first page in the document.

[Integrating with ASP.NET](/examples/aspnet-integration) - how to return PDF files generated within ASP.NET endpoints.
