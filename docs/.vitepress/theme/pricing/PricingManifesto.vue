    <h2>Modern Open-Source Manifesto</h2>

    <p>Open-source projects are an important foundation for the software development ecosystem. Modern applications are depending more and more upon the work of enthusiast and experts. Open-source is not anymore just sharing knowledge and passion with everybody. Over last years, maintaining and developing those projects have became a highly responsible task.</p>

    <p>We identify the importance of the QuestPDF library in your projects, and therefore want to make sure you can safely and confidently continue the development. We strongly believe that a dual-licensing model is the best solution for all users: providing the best development experience and feature set for everybody and every project, but also offering stability for every professional and enterprise product.</p>

    <p>Being a healthy and growing community is our primary goal that motivates us to pursue professionalism.</p>
