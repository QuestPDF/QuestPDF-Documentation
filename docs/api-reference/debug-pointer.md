Inserts a virtual debug element visible in the document hierarchy tree in the QuestPDF Companion App, as well as in the enhanced debugging message provided by the DocumentLayoutException.
It does not appear in the final PDF output.

## Example

```c#{2-4}
container
    .Width(100)
    .DebugPointer("Product details section")
    .Width(150)
    .Column(column =>
    {
        column.Item().Text("Coffee Beans");
        column.Item().Text("$19.99");
    });
```

The code above throws an exception with the following element trace:

```c#{20}
The provided document content contains conflicting size constraints. For example, some elements may require more space than is available. 

The layout issue is likely present in the following part of the document: 

-> Document

-> Page

-> Page

-> Content

-> Content

-> In method:   content
   Called from: Render
   Source path: /Users/marcinziabek/RiderProjects/QuestPDF/Source/QuestPDF.Examples/Engine/RenderingTest.cs
   Line number: 100

-> Product details section

Legend: 
游뚿 - Element that is likely the root cause of the layout issue based on library heuristics and prediction. 
游댮 - Element that cannot be drawn due to the provided layout constraints. This element likely causes the layout issue, or one of its descendant children is responsible for the problem. 
游리 - Element that can be partially drawn on the page and will also be rendered on the consecutive page. In more complex layouts, this element may also cause issues or contain a child that is the actual root cause.
游릭 - Element that is successfully and completely drawn on the page.
丘쀮잺 - Element that has not been drawn on the faulty page. Its children are omitted.
